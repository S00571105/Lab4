## Executive Summary 
This section examined operating systems and allowed for the practice of working with the command line of my operating systems. In addition this section explored additional software Python IDLE, code examples, variables, assignment statements, functions, data types, including an interactive programming environment, graphics, file formats and diagramming.

## Python IDLE
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. However, in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor. IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package.

## Code Examples
The similarities of all three of these codes are they are used in image technology, are the most popular ones used and are compatible with modern browsers, broadband speed and the needs of the average user. The differences are; JPG format is a lossy  compressed file format and this makes it useful for storing photographs at a smaller size than a BMP; whereby GIF is a good choice for storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size and GIF is a good choice for storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size and PNG is a portable network graphics that is excellent for internet graphics.

### Variable
Variables are containers for storing data values. Variables in Python are names given to objects, so that it becomes easy to refer a value. In other words, a variable points to an object. An example of variable is age, country or vehicle type.

### Assignment statement
Assignment statements to assign objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object or Python creates a variable name the first time when they are assigned a value. An example of this would be a=1.

### Function
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. Python functions return a value using a return statement, if one is specified. A function can be called anywhere after the function has been declared. An example of a built if function would be abs() this is the most popular Python built in function the returns the absolute value of a number.

### Three data types
Python data types are integer, floating point numbers and strings. The integer (or int) data type indicates values that are whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers (or floats). Python programs can also have text values called strings.

## Graphics
Methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. The term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Vector graphics are digital art that is rendered by a computer using a mathematical formula. Raster images are made up of tiny pixels, making them resolution dependent and best used for creating photos. Raster images are made of pixels, or tiny dots that use color and tone to produce the image. .An example of raster images is JPEG, GIF, and PNG and an example of vector graphics is EPS and PICT.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
In lossless compression it allows you to retain the quality of your images while reducing their size versus in lossy compression some of the data from an original file such as JPEG is lost. So the benefit of lossy compression is basically it reduces file sized. However with lossy you also have quality loss.

### File Formats
The file format is the structure of a file that tells a program how to display its contents. For example, a Microsoft Word document saved in the .DOC file format is best viewed in Microsoft Word. Other file formats are JPEG, GIF and PNG.

### File Properties
Under file properties when you right click you can see the filename, type of file, location of file, size of file, size on disk, file creation date and time, file modification date and time, file access date and time and more advanced information.

## Conclusion
In conclusion this section was very interesting it examined operating systems and allowed for the practice of working with the command line of my operating systems. In addition this section explored additional software Python IDLE, code examples, variables, assignment statements, functions, data types, including an interactive programming environment, graphics, file formats and diagramming.
